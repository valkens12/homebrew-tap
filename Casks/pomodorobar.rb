# Homebrew Cask template for PomodoroBar.
#
# This file lives in the source repo with placeholder version and sha256
# fields below. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) renders
# the real values per published tag, attaches the filled cask to the GitHub
# Release, and pushes it straight to the valkens12/homebrew-tap repo so users
# can:
#
#   brew tap valkens12/tap
#   brew install --cask pomodorobar
#
# The app is ad-hoc signed and NOT notarized, so first launch needs a one-time
# Gatekeeper bypass (see caveats below).

    <<~EOS
      PomodoroBar is ad-hoc signed and not notarized. On first launch macOS
      Gatekeeper will block it. This is a one-time step -- run:

          xattr -cr /Applications/PomodoroBar.app

      or right-click the app in /Applications -> Open -> Open Anyway.
